"
PulseGate is a class that selectively allows specific pulses to pass through from a sequence of impulses generated by an existing pulse generator. This class is configured to allow only the mth pulse in every group of n pulses, effectively ""gating"" impulses based on this pattern.

Purpose
The PulseGate is useful in scenarios where you want to control the flow of pulses, only letting certain pulses pass from a repetitive stream according to a defined interval.

Usage
Initialize PulseGate with an existing pulse generator and specify the values of m and n:

m: The position of the pulse to let through in each group.
n: The size of each group of pulses.
For example, if m = 1 and n = 4, PulseGate will pass through only the first pulse of every four pulses from the generator.
