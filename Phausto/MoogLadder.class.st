"
Virtual analog model of the 4th-order Moog Ladder, which is arguably the most well-known ladder filter in analog synthesizers. Several 1st-order filters are cascaded in series. Feedback is then used, in part, to control the cut-off frequency and the resonance.

Parameters:
normFreq: normalized frequency (0-1)
Q: quality factor between .707 (0 feedback coefficient) to 25 (feedback = 4, which is the self-oscillating threshold).
