Simple marimba physical model implementing a single tone bar connected to tube.
The marimba is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars that are struck by mallets. Below each bar is a resonator pipe that amplifies particular harmonics of its sound.
The term is of Bantu origin, deriving from the prefix ma- meaning 'many' and -rimba meaning 'xylophone'.
